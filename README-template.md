## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript


### What I learned

Just keep building even when you fail -_-!



### Continued development

I want to just continue building. Sometimes the simpler projects can be more challenging. This was the case for me. I'm not fully satisfied with the outcome. I will continue working on the fundamentals.



### Useful resources

- [JavaScript Client-side Form Validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsd4FNGTRBw) - Great walk through of client side validation and form setup.

## Acknowledgments

Mdn is always useful but I found Florin Pop's video on client-side form validation to be a great resource.
